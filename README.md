# DA3C Fluid Model for MDFSP

This repository contains the code for the paper: 

****

## Requirements

To run the code, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
Python==3.6.13
CUDA==10.2.89
Pytorch==1.10.0
Numpy==1.19.5
Conda==4.10.3
```
## Project Structure:
The project is organized into several key directories:
```
environment/: Contains the Python-based discretization simulation environment for workshop scheduling.
data/: Includes the public dataset used for training and evaluation.
agents/: Contains the main program code implementing the algorithms.
result/: Directory to save the trained models and output from the experiments.
```
## Usage Tips
```
1. Set up the environment: Use Conda to create a virtual environment with the specified dependencies.
2. Run experiments: Navigate to the agents/ directory and execute the main program to start training.
3. Save results: Trained models and logs will be saved in the result/ directory for further analysis.
